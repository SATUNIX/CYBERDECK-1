# CYBERDECK MK-1.0

Introducing the ultimate tool for all your Phase 1 recon and OSINT needs - the CYBERDECK MK1.0! But what exactly is it, you ask? 
Well, picture this: you slowly mix the following in a large bowl: A bunch of copper, nodoz, redbull, silicone, and sheer will, and what do you get?
You guessed it - the CYBERDECK MK1.0!


This amazing repository contains files and programs to help you build your very own cyberdeck.
Using these scripts, you can easily build a budget-friendly cyberdeck that packs a serious punch in terms of processing power (for its size).
With the power of the Raspberry Pi's keyboard computer combo, a DFrobot screen and driver, along with the much-loved Kali toolset and Aircrack software, you can create a nifty little network auditing and packet sniffing cyberdeck that will blow your mind!

Gone are the days of struggling to find the right tools for your network security testing needs. With the CYBERDECK MK1.0, you have everything you need to perform advanced network analysis and attacks. So what are you waiting for? Build your very own cyberdeck today and take your network security game to the next level!

May your Phase 1 recon and OSINT needs be considered done. With the CYBERDECK MK1.0

# INSTALLATION

Clone the CYBERDECK repository using the following command:

```

git clone https://github.com/SATUNIX/CYBERDECK.git

```

Navigate to the CYBERDECK directory:

```

cd CYBERDECK

```

Run the scripts for different steps of the installation:

(The programs will reboot throughout several times) 
(They install drivers, edit config files, create oneshot processes etc) 

```

sudo ./REQUIREMENTS_PATCH.sh
reboot
sudo ./LCD_INSTALLER.sh
reboot
sudo ./TPLINK_PATCH.sh

```

Once the installation is complete, reboot the system:

```

reboot

```

After rebooting, the CYBERDECK tools will be available in the ~/CYBERDECK directory.


#### Alternatively:
run the bineriser.sh script to have the python program run as through a shell command no matter where you are in the Linux filesystem. 
Make sure you don't move the github package or it will no longer work. 

# HARDWARE Used  
1. Pi400 - RASPBERRY PI 
2. 3.5" DFROBOT TFT For raspberry pi 
3. Adafruit Cyberdeck 
4. ANKO Battery pack or something similar with 5V - 2A USBC or USBA to USBC (pi400 takes USBC)
5. TPLINK TP-Link TL-WN722N (Version 2 or 3 is fine) 

Save yourself some money by running my patch above. (Credit to David Bombal - couldn't have done it without you) 
My Amazon package got stolen so I had to make to with a TPLINK instead of a $106AUD ALFA Card. 
Whoever stole my package and altered the course of history on this project... I will find you.

# SOFTWARE (HOME GROWN)
1. F600_AstraAudit.py 

  A python tool to provide a one stop shop for CLI ease of use and configurations. 
  Trust me, when your working on a 3.5" screen, you might as well make a program to automate small tasks. 
  //Never go full skiddy. 
  ([Final version 6.0.0] Auditing software)
  (NO DEBUGGING CURRENTLY) 
  (This software comes with absolutely no warranty or liability)
  
2. TRITIUM_LAN1 

  Something else I started but didnt finish, I kept it in here for someone else to have a look at an improve. 
  
3. LCD CONFIG: 

  Installs the drivers, runs a script for the LCD Display, then modifys the /boot/config.txt file to rotate the display and flip the touch input (not that you need to) 
  
4. TPLINK_CONFIG: 
  Uses Davids patch and automates his process, Modified and simplified to run specifically on kali linux ARM machines such as what ive got. 
    
    

# SOFTWARE (DRIVERS) 

For the TPLINK "TL-WN722N" 
The David Bombal patch: Run the shell script above using the method outlined by David Bombal on his github. My script is just an automation of this method. 
Uses the aircrack-ng eus driver 

For the 3.5" LCD on ADAFRUIT CYBERDECK 
Connect to the internet or other WAN and run my patch with sudo privalages, you can check the file to make sure nothing fishy is going on. 
This is specifically for the 3.5 inch waveshare model you can edit this it will have heaops of comments in the shell script.
